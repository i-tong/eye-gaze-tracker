# External libraries

This folder contains the external libraries used by the gaze tracker program. You will need to get the lib files for eye gaze tracking and other dependencies from the RCL website (link to follow) and unpackage the files into the lib folder. Follow the instructions in the top-level README.md file for details on deployment.
